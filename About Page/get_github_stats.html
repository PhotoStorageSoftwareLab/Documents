	<h2>The Problem</h2>
	<hr style="width:500px; float:left; margin-top:-1em">
	<p>
	  Cloud storage has reached tipping points, specifically in security/privacy and processing/storage
	  equipment. There are ways to keep your data safe from cloud storage locations and companies, but
	  those solutions do not provide the level of features that the cloud storage solution offers. One
	  specific pain point in removing one's information from cloud storage is the loss of photo gallery
	  apps and tools.
	</p>

	<h2>Our Purpose</h2>
	<hr style="width:500px; float:left; margin-top:-1em">
	<p>
	  This website serves to provide a security as well as all the features you would expect in a photo
	  gallery application, such as excellent features like image tagging and classification, sharing
	  across users, and location tagging of each photo. All of these tags are then searchable, which
	  means the user can just search their gallery for "Colorado" or "bicycles" and get their images
	  associated. Additionally, the backend we use, Nextcloud, is HIPAA-certified and open source. Open
	  source is a huge win for privacy and security because it allows auditing by millions.
	</p>

	<h2>Intended Users</h2>
	<hr style="width:500px; float:left; margin-top:-1em">
	<p>
	  This application is meant for those who own their own local storage and would like to remotely
	  upload, edit, and tag their photos from anywhere in the world. If you are concerned with the
	  security of your photos, this is the application for you.

	  This site has a list of popular locations and their Latitude and Longitude filtered by city. The
	  HTML tables on this site can be easily extracted (they are simple HTML tables). However, to get
	  all locations, we need to programmatically shift through multiple pages since each page is limited
	  to a single city. We can use a list of cities from the next sources to achieve this. This can be
	  done using Python and Scrapy.

	<h1>Tools</h1>

	<p style="width:750px">
	  The primary tool used in this project is Nextcloud. Nextcloud will provide local storage to store
	  photos on a machine in the user’s local network. These photos will be uploaded through a dedicated
	  web application. This web application will be created with a combination of Javascript and React,
	  built for a Node environment. Image processing will be handled through YOLO, a C++ image
	  recognition system. YOLO comes with a neural network named darknet developed by the same person.
	  Additionally, YOLO has default weights with classifications for over 9000 objects. The YOLO
	  associated set of tools handles this part for us so we do not need to reinvent the wheel.
	  Nextcloud’s web application toolkit also includes PHP (with PHPUnit for unit testing) and MySQL
	  for the backend. Because most of the front-end programming is built for the front-end, we intend
	  to use web development tools that are included in the browser of choice. We may also utilize
	  Selenium for comprehensive design tests. We also are using tools for us to manage a project of
	  this scope. We will be keeping our code on GitHub in a group so that we can have multiple
	  repositories for different aspects of the project. Additionally, all non-code files, such as this
	  report, are kept on a team Google Drive (semi-ironic). Lastly, we have created a Slack group with
	  dedicated channels for things like the application development vs general communication. For Data
	  Scraping, we created a scraping script in Python using a data scraping module called Scrapy.
